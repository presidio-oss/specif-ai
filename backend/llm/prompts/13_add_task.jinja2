User Story Description:
{{description}}

Task Id:
{{taskId}}

{{taskDescription}}

FileContent:
{{fileContent}}

Develop a detailed and well-structured task strictly derived from provided client requests and information from file content, with no additional or irrelevant information included. 
The "Client Request - Task Description" can be expanded to derive acceptance criteria based on provided input but do not include additional or irrelevant content.
An apt task name should be generated based on the updated acceptance criteria.

STRICT:
(!) Ensure to categorize the task based on client request as frontend, backend, API integration, UX screens, Infra changes if applicable.
(!) Output Structure should be a valid JSON: Here is the sample Structure. Follow this exactly. Do not add or change the response JSON:

            "<task name>": "[description of the task]  \n#### Acceptance Criteria:  \n[acceptance criteria for the task as sentences]"
        }
    ]
}
