#### ✨ Agentic Solution Requirement Generation Flow

Specif AI utilises the Langgraph framework to deliver an efficient agentic workflow, enhancing the creation of solution requirements with precision. Following are the key phases involved:

- **Context Gathering Phase:** 
  - **Summarisation:** Analyses solution metadata and conversation history, employing summarisation to manage conversation context data effectively.
  - **Context Gathering:** Integrates data from a Knowledge-Base, incorporating adaptable MCP server tools for enhanced flexibility.
  - **Decision Point:** Assesses the need for Large Language Model (LLM) tool execution, iterating until the tool executions phase is complete.
  - **Data Consolidation** Organises data into a structured ReferenceInfo format.
- **Requirement Generation Phase**: The structured output from previous phase drives the creation of Business Requirements Document (BRD), Product Requirements Document (PRD), Non-functional Requirements Document (NFR) and User Interface Requirements (UIR). 

This Agentic architecture ensures seamless task orchestration and accelerates the solution  creation process.
