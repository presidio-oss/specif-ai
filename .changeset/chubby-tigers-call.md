The login form UI has been updated to create a more spacious and cleaner design. The main changes include widening the login card from 480px to 640px and removing animation effects for a more straightforward user experience. The HTML structure was simplified by removing unnecessary spacing classes and adding proper padding for mobile responsiveness. The form container now uses a cleaner layout with consistent spacing between input sections. These modifications create a more professional and user-friendly login interface while maintaining all existing functionality
