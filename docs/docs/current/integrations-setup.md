</div>

### ✨ Features and Benefits

* **Automated Ticket Creation:** Convert PRDs, User Stories, and Tasks into JIRA epics, stories, and tasks, maintaining hierarchy.
* **Bulk Export:** Export multiple stories and tasks at once, saving manual creation time.
* **Seamless Synchronization:** Create and update JIRA tickets based on Specifai changes, ensuring data consistency.

### ⚡ Quick Start Guide

1.  **Prerequisites:** You'll need an active JIRA instance, administrator access (or relevant permissions) to create JIRA OAuth apps, and the Specifai desktop application.

2.  **Detailed Setup:** For comprehensive OAuth configuration and permissions, refer to our [Jira OAuth 2.0 Integration Guide](JIRA-README.md).

3.  **Sync to JIRA:**
    * From the **PRD** page in Specifai, select your PRD and go to its **Stories** tab.
    * Click **Export** and choose **Sync to JIRA**.

        *Initiate sync to JIRA from the Export menu*

        </div>
    * Tickets are automatically created in JIRA with these mappings:
        * **Epic**: PRD
        * **Story**: User Story
        * **Task**: Task
    * You'll receive a notification upon sync completion. JIRA Ticket IDs are displayed in Specifai next to corresponding requirements for easy reference and search.

## 🚀 AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base Direct Solution Integration

Connect your enterprise knowledge base to Specifai's AI chat, enhancing suggestions and enabling context-aware requirement generation for all document types.

### ✨ Benefits & Features

* **Enhanced Chat Suggestions:** Leverage organizational knowledge for insightful AI chat assistance.
* **Context-Aware Generation:** Create precise requirements using context from your knowledge base (e.g., domain info).
* **Historical Data Integration:** Integrate past data (e.g., previous requirements) for informed creation.

### 🛠 Setup Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:** You'll need an AWS Knowledge Base containing relevant context (domain info, past requirements) and an IAM key with `bedrock:ListKnowledgeBases`, `bedrock:GetKnowledgeBase`, `bedrock:Retrieve` permissions.
    <div align="center">

    *Configure your AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base connection*

    </div>

2.  **Existing Bedrock LLM Config (Optional):** If your existing AWS Bedrock LLM configuration has the necessary permissions, simply check **"Use existing Bedrock configuration from LLM settings"**.

3.  **Direct API Key Config:** Alternatively, configure AWS API Keys directly using the provided form fields.

4.  **Knowledge Base ID:** Accurately enter your AWS Knowledge Base ID.

5.  **Connect:** Click "**Connect**" to establish the link between Specifai and your AWS Knowledge Base.

### ✅ Verification Steps

* **Verify KB Access:** Confirm Specifai can access and retrieve data from your AWS KB.
* **Test Chat Suggestions:** Verify AI chat suggestions are enhanced and relevant, drawing from the KB.

### 🛠 Custom MCP Server Integration

Beyond built-in options, Specifai enables custom MCP server integration, extending functionality with proprietary data or specialized applications (e.g., a file system MCP server).

#### Configuring Custom MCP Servers

1.  **Navigate to MCP Integrations:** Access **MCP Integrations** during **Solution Creation** or in **Settings > Integrations**.

    <div align="center">

    ![MCP Server Integration in Create Solution](/img/mcp/custom-server-management.png)

    </div>

    ---

2.  **Add New MCP Server:** From the **"MCP Integrations"** tab, select **"New MCP Server"**.

3.  **Provide Details:**
    * **Server ID:** A unique identifier (e.g., `filesystem`).
    * **Server Configuration (JSON):** Define communication parameters.
        ```json
        {
          "command": "npm",
          "transportType": "stdio",
          "args": ["run", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/your/path/to/Mcp"],
          "id": "filesystem"
        }
        ```

    <div align="center">

### 💡 How MCP Enhances Requirement Workflows

MCP tools are dynamically invoked during the **research step** within Specifai's agentic workflows, gathering crucial information that directly impacts output quality.

MCP specifically enhances:

1.  **Solution Generation:** Improves **BRD, PRD, NFR, and UIR** accuracy by providing contextual information.
2.  **User Story & Task Generation:** Contributes to the research phase for relevant and actionable **User Stories and Tasks**.
3.  **AI Chat Assistance:** Refines **AI chat suggestions** with real-time contextual information.
