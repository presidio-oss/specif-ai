# Troubleshooting & FAQs for Specifai

This guide helps you resolve common issues you might encounter while using Specifai, an intelligent platform that turns project ideas into structured requirements and actionable tasks.

## Common Issues

### Installation & Launch Issues

1.  **Specifai Won't Install**
    * **Verify System Requirements:** Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements for running an Electron application (e.g., sufficient RAM, CPU).
    * **Check Disk Space:** Confirm you have enough free disk space for the installation.
    * **Run as Administrator:** Try running the installer with administrator privileges.
    * **Antivirus/Firewall Interference:** Temporarily disable your antivirus or firewall to see if it's blocking the installation (remember to re-enable it afterward).

2.  **Specifai Won't Launch or Behaves Unexpectedly**
    * **Verify Installation Completion:** Ensure the installation process completed without errors.
    * **Restart Your System:** A system restart can sometimes resolve unexpected launch issues.
    * **Clear Electron Store/User Data:**
        * The Electron store saves application settings and user data. Corrupted data here can cause launch failures or strange behavior.
        * **Location:**
            * **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Specif AI` (or `C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Roaming\Specif AI`)
            * **macOS:** `/Users/Username/Library/Application Support/Specif AI`
        * **Action:** Navigate to the appropriate folder for your operating system and delete the contents of the `Specif AI` folder (or the entire folder if you want a complete reset). **Note:** This will clear all application settings, preferences, and potentially local project data (if stored within this directory). Back up any important files before proceeding.
    * **Reinstall Specifai:** If logs don't provide clues and clearing the store doesn't help, a clean reinstall might be necessary.

### UI-Specific Issues

#### Interface Rendering Problems

- **Window Refresh:** If the UI becomes unresponsive or displays incorrectly, try closing and reopening the application window.
- **Display Scaling:** Check your system's display scaling settings if UI elements appear too large or small.
- **Graphics Issues:** Update your graphics driver if you experience visual glitches or rendering problems.


### Workspace & Configuration Issues

1.  **Workspace Configuration Errors**
    * **Problem:** "Unable to create workspace directory" or issues saving project files.
    * **Solution:**
        * **Ensure Write Permissions:** Verify that Specifai has write permissions to the selected workspace location.
        * **Choose a Different Location:** Try setting your workspace to a different directory, ideally one within your user profile (e.g., "Documents" folder).
        * **Run Application as Administrator (Windows):** If permissions are consistently an issue, try running Specifai with administrator privileges (right-click the shortcut and select "Run as administrator").

2.  **AI Model Configuration Issues**
    * **Problem:** "Unable to connect to AI model" or AI features are not working.
    * **Solution:**
        * **Verify API Credentials:** If Specifai uses external AI models (e.g., OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Gemini) via API keys, ensure your API credentials are correct and haven't expired.
        * **Check Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection is required to communicate with external AI models.
        * **Confirm Model Availability:** Verify that the chosen AI model service is operational (check the provider's status page).
        * **Review Rate Limits:** AI models usually have rate limits. If you're making many requests, you might be temporarily throttled.

### Integration Problems

1.  **Jira Integration**
    * **Verify OAuth Credentials:** Ensure your Jira OAuth credentials are correctly configured in Specifai.
    * **Check Callback URL Configuration:** The callback URL in Jira's application link setup must match what Specifai expects.
    * **Ensure Proper Permissions:** The Jira user account used for integration needs sufficient permissions to create/update issues and projects.
    * **Validate Project Key:** Ensure the Jira project key you're trying to integrate with is correct and accessible.

2.  **Azure DevOps Integration**
    * **Verify Personal Access Token:** Ensure your Azure DevOps PAT is correctly configured and hasn't expired.
    * **Check Token Permissions:** The PAT must have "Work Items: Read & write" and "Project and team: Read" permissions.
    * **Validate Organization and Project Names:** Ensure the organization and project names are spelled correctly and match exactly (case-sensitive).
    * **Confirm Project Access:** Verify that your account has access to the specified Azure DevOps project.
    * **Check Work Item Types:** Ensure the work item types (Feature, Platform Feature, User Story) exist in your ADO project.
    * **Network Connectivity:** Verify that your network allows connections to `dev.azure.com`.

3.  **AWS Bedrock KB**
    * **Confirm AWS Credentials:** Verify your AWS access key ID and secret access key are correctly configured and have the necessary permissions for Bedrock KB access.
    * **Verify Region Configuration:** Ensure the AWS region configured in Specifai matches your Bedrock Knowledge Base region.
    * **Check Tag Key Setup:** If Specifai uses specific tags to identify Bedrock KBs, ensure they are correctly set up.
    * **Test AWS CLI Access:** As a diagnostic step, try accessing your Bedrock KB using the AWS CLI from your system to rule out credential or network issues.

## Observability - Telemetry Data
    * Specifai collects user usage data to improve the application
    * Disable telemetry in settings if desired

## Performance Optimization

### Slow Response Times

1.  **Document/Requirements Generation**
    * **Optimize Input Size:** While Specifai aims to handle complex ideas, extremely large or unstructured initial inputs might take longer to process.
    * **Check Network Speed:** If using cloud-based AI models, a slow internet connection can impact generation speed.
    * **Monitor System Resources:** Ensure your computer has sufficient RAM and CPU available. Close other resource-intensive applications.

2.  **AI Model Responses**
    * **Select Appropriate Model:** More complex or "intelligent" AI models can be slower. If speed is critical for certain tasks, consider if a less complex model would suffice.
    * **Optimize Prompt Length:** Very long or ambiguous user content (during solution generation, task creation, etc.) might lead to slower AI responses.
    * **Consider Local Models:** If Specifai supports local AI models (e.g., via Ollama), using them can be faster as it eliminates network latency.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage
