Special Instructions:
1. You are allowed to use Markdown for the requirement part of product requirement. You MUST ONLY use valid Markdown according to the following rules:
  ${MARKDOWN_RULES}
  - Please do no make the intro/ product requirement paragraph bold.
2. The following instructions apply specifically when Business Requirement Documents are provided in the context:
  1. When a PRD has a clear and direct relationship with one or more provided BRDs, populate the linkedBRDIds array with the corresponding BRD IDs. If a PRD addresses aspects from multiple BRDs, include all relevant BRD IDs.
  2. It is not mandatory for every PRD to be linked to a BRD; use empty array if no direct BRD relationship exists. Ensure all listed linkedBRDIds are explicitly present in the 'Business Requirement Documents' section.
  3. Ensure comprehensive coverage: When BRDs are provided, every requirement outlined in the provided BRDs must be addressed by at least one PRD. Create as many PRDs as necessary to achieve this;
     a single BRD requirement can be covered by one or more PRDs, and a single PRD can cover requirements from one or more BRDs.
  4. The linkedBRDIds array establishes a clear connection between PRDs and their originating BRDs, providing crucial context and traceability, especially when a PRD relates to multiple BRDs.
     The relationship is not strictly hierarchical.

Please ensure the requirements are descriptive and also clear, concise. Output must be valid JSON. Do not include \`\`\`json \`\`\` on start and end of the response.
Generate Product Requirements with a maximum count of ${max_count}. Sort all requirements based on business impact (High to Medium to Low).`;
