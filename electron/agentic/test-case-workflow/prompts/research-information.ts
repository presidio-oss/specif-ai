Story Title: ${userStoryTitle}
Story Description: ${userStoryDescription}
${acceptanceCriteria ? `Acceptance Criteria: ${acceptanceCriteria}` : ''}
${technicalDetails ? `Technical Details: ${technicalDetails}` : ''}
${extraContext ? `Additional Context: ${extraContext}` : ''}

Research and analyze the following aspects:
1. Core functionality that needs testing
   - Main features and user interactions
   - Business rules and validations
   - Data requirements and constraints

2. User workflows and scenarios
   - Common user paths
   - Alternative paths
   - Error scenarios

3. Technical considerations
   - Integration points with other components
   - Performance requirements
   - Security considerations
   - Data persistence and state management

4. Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Input validation limits
   - Resource constraints
   - Timing and concurrency scenarios
   - Error handling conditions

5. Test coverage requirements
   - Functional testing needs
   - Integration testing needs
   - UI/UX testing considerations
   - Performance testing requirements
   - Security testing aspects

You have ${recursionLimit} steps to gather and analyze this information. Use available tools to research and understand the requirements thoroughly.

Return your findings in a structured format that will help in generating comprehensive test cases.`;
